    "#### Tree Formation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create the tree using any heirarchical labels in the output labels if they exist. Otherwise create a tree with a single root node and one leaf for every classification label.\n",
    "* Walk down the tree starting at the root and stop when the current node has more children than desired. Then:\n",
    "    * Place the category texts of the child nodes in a vector store and generate embeddings for each of them.\n",
    "    * Sample from the vector store to choose relatively spread out categories. This is done by performing KMeans clustering and choosing cluster representatives.\n",
    "    * Provide the LLM with representative categories and ask it to create new categories that divide those further.\n",
    "    * Classify the old child categories into the newly created categories.\n",
    "    * Place old child categories that cannot be classified into the new categories as children of the current node.\n",
    "    * Repeat this process until less than or equal to the desired number of categories is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start at the root node and work down the tree.\n",
    "* Prompt the LLM to choose the correct next category from among the children of the current node if a valid one exists.\n",
    "* If a the LLM responds saying that node of the child categories are suitable for the item to be classified, mask/hide the current node and treat the parent of the current node as the next node.\n",
    "* If the failure above occurs while the current node is the root, the item will be skipped and receive no classification."
