# LLM-Powered Decision Trees For Classification

## Dataset:
[UNSPSC Codes](https://data.ok.gov/dataset/unspsc-codes)

## Complete:
* Determine first dataset
* Read file, explore sub-branching dimensions and evaluate requirements
* Form tree using existing heirarchical elements and validate structure against original dataset
* Visualize tree

## To-Do:
* Add additional nodes after nodes with too many children to make decisions
* Categorize products from public dataset
* Check categorizations manually and test for ambiguous pathing
* Evaluate LLM cost and performance
